# Election Audit
## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

### Purpose

First purpose is that Tom's manager, Seth, would like him to become familiar
with the command line, which will be used to make updates to the
repository, access local files and folders, and write and run Python
scripts. Seth learns all of that about Python so that it can help Tom with
the election analysis. In the process Seth learns Git technologies and also
learns how to use the Visual Studio code to the election analysis for
the three counties in Colorado.

Now Seth is going to sit down with Tom to go over what needs to be completed for
the election audit, and discuss the information needed by the
Colorado Board of Elections. Seth creates the following summary tables on the
election results.

to use his firm who has expertise in Data Analytics to give a project for the whole state election
